      <p class="section-body">
        Bird banding is the process of placing metal bracelets with unique numbers on the legs of birds and collecting various data points on bird health and life history. Opperating under federally-issued permits, bird banding stations have strict procedures and protocols to ensure the safety of the bird and efficiency of the data collection at all times. This app was created to make bird banding station tasks even more streamline, as well as provide a resource for new bird banders as they learn the ropes of the station.

      <p class="section-title">The Initial Design</p>
      <p class="section-body">
        The initial design for this project was built in Figma, which allowed me to plan out how each page of the app would look and mock up the functionality of buttons that connect to other pages.
      </p>

    <div class="section">
      <p class="section-title">The Final Design</p>
      <p class="section-body">
        The final design includes a map feature where users can click on mist nets and gather information on the location of poles and rebar, location of fixed ends, and any special conditions (ex. Soft soil, susceptible to high winds, poison oak). Users can also also easily access information on net round times, time until next net round, and connect with other bird banders at their banding station. Another feature also allows users to report issues with specific nets (ex. Broken rock, replace materials, vegetation trimming needed) and see notifications submitted by other banders.

        This format can easily be adopted for other banding stations. All that would be required would be to add new nets and their locations on a map and add new profiles.
