      <p class="section-body">
        The Bear Divide Bird Banding Station works to band the thousands of birds that migrate through the San Gabriel Mountains of Santa Clarita, California each spring since 2021. After volunteering there as a bird bander for the 2023 spring season, I designed their website for a paid summer internship through Pasadena Unified School District's Career Pathways program.

          <p class="section-title">My Role</p>
          <p class="section-body">
            As web designer and product manager, my role was to communicate with the banding station's leads to determine what content should be featured on the website. I went through a shared media folder to collect writing for the website text and photos to add to the header of pages, body paragraphs, and media page. I also researched available domains and servers to find the most cost-effective prices for a station that runs solely on donations and grants.

          <p class="section-title">Requirements & Needs</p>
          <p class="section-body">
            The Bear Divide Bird Banding Station receives hundreds of visitors each spring, so communicating with the public about the research and process has always been a focus. This website had to serve as a place for visitors and bird enthusiasts to learn more about the background of the station and the research being conducted. The website also serves as a resource for people interested in bird banding who want to band at the station or learn about Bear Divide's protocols and practices.

      <p class="section-title">The Initial Design</p>
      <p class="section-body">
        I designed the website using Wordpress, HTML, and CSS. After working with one of the lead bird banders of the station, we determined what pages the website should include. From there, I built the home page and about page as well as pages to learn information about visiting the station, the research, how to get involved, how to support the station, view media, and find resources on the station and bird banding in general.
